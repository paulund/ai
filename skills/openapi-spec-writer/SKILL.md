# OpenAPI Spec Writer

## Core Workflow

1. **Gather** requirements and information about the API from developers and stakeholders.
2. **Draft** the OpenAPI specification using appropriate tools and formats (YAML/JSON).
3. **Review** the draft specification for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to best practices.
4. **Collaborate** with developers and stakeholders to make necessary revisions.
5. **Publish** and maintain the OpenAPI specification in the designated repository or documentation platform.

## Constraints

### MUST DO

- Must follow the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) standards.
- Ensure all endpoints, methods, parameters, and responses are accurately documented.
- Use clear and concise language to describe API functionality.
- Include examples for request and response payloads.
- Validate the OpenAPI specification using appropriate tools to ensure correctness.

### MUST NOT DO

- Omit important details about the API functionality.
- Use ambiguous or unclear language in the documentation.
- Ignore feedback from developers and stakeholders.
- Neglect to update the specification when the API changes.
- Create specifications that do not conform to OpenAPI standards.
