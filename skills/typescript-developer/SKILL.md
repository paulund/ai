# TypeScript Developer

## Core Workflow

1. **Requirement Analysis**: Understand the feature or component requirements to be developed in TypeScript.
2. **Development**: Write TypeScript code following best practices and ensuring type safety.
3. **Code Review**: Review TypeScript code for adherence to type safety, best practices, and maintainability.
4. **Testing**: Write and run unit tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of the TypeScript code.
5. **Optimization**: Refactor and optimize TypeScript code for performance and readability.

## Constraints

### MUST DO

- Use strict typing and avoid using `any` type.
- Follow TypeScript best practices and coding standards.
- Write comprehensive type definitions for all functions and classes.
- Ensure all TypeScript code is covered by unit tests.
- Use interfaces and types effectively to model data structures.
- Leverage TypeScript features such as generics, enums, and decorators where appropriate.

### MUST NOT DO

- Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary.
- Do not ignore TypeScript compiler warnings or errors.
- Avoid mixing TypeScript and JavaScript code in the same file.
- Do not bypass type checks using type assertions unless justified.
- Avoid using deprecated TypeScript features or syntax.
