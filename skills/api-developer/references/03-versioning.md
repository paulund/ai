# 3. Versioning

- Reference for: API Developer Skill
- Load when: When planning breaking changes or deprecating API versions.

Breaking changes should be a last resort. They should not be made lightly. Whenever a breaking change is needed you MUST ask the user for confirmation before proceeding.

Prefix breaking changes with a version: /v1/, /v2/.

Keep previous versions stable until all consumers migrate.

Plan deprecation: document timeline + migration notes.
